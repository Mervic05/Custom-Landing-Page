### What I learned

I learned how to implement dropdown menus with this project. It was also my first project creating a mobile responsive menu section. It was a great experience and I'd love to continue building.

### Continued development

Going forword, I'd love to explore the power of CSS Grid and more of JavaScript. Expect more of my project submissions.

### Useful resources

-[https://youtu.be/WQJeaQyA5NM]- This Youtube video helped me to figure out the dropdown menu that was a pain in the ass. Shout out to the creators. -[Kelvin Powell's Youtube channel] - This is an amazing channel which helped me finally understand flexbox which i used extensively for this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

It was a bumpy one for me. I got so frustrated at some point but I kept on going with the hope that I'll figure it out - and I did. It is not really to perfection but I'm so proud of myself that i was able to code this from top to bottom. I also thank God for the patience and consistency that kept me going.
